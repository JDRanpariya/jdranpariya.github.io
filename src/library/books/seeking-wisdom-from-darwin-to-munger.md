>A man who has committed a mistake and doesn't correct it, is committing another mistake.
> â€” Confucius

What do we want out of life? To be healthy, happy with our families, in our
work, etc? What interferes with this? Isn't it often emotions like fear, anger, worry,
disappointment, stress, and sadness caused by problems, mistakes, losses, or
unreal expectations? Maybe we misjudged people, situations, the time or some
investment. We chose the wrong occupation, spouse, investment, or place to live.
Why?

Charles Munger,
Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. who says, ''All I want to know is
where I'm going to die so I'll never go there." There are roads that lead to
unhappiness. An understanding of how and why we can "die" should help us
avoid them. [[Poet]], I just wanted to learn poetry in between, LOL.

**I advise all of you ro read the annual reports of Berkshire Hathaway and Wesco**
**Financial (Charles Munger is chairman). These reports are the best educational**
**tools about how to think about investing and business. The lessons also show us**
**how to behave in life.**

Checklists often eliminate biases and
make it easier for us to be sure we've covered the important things.

Read *Richard Feynman* and Human Ecology Professor *Garrett Hardin*(For clear thinking)

It's one of the best introductions I've ever read until now, Aug 24, 2025. I'm high on adrenaline, at least the feeling.

We learned how pain and pleasure guide our behavior, how we tend to take the most
rewarding view of events, how we make quick judgments, and are social animals.
We also saw how we have developed a strong aversion to loss and uncertainty, and
how it is natural for people to behave in ways they perceive is in their best interests.
