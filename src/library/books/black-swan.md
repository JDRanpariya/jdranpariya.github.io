# Introduction

Re-reading chapters on randomness and fragility.  

> Taleb’s emphasis on "silent evidence" is crucial for my AI work[^1].

## The Impact of the Highly Improbable

Black swan events shape our history in disproportionate ways.  
Understanding them requires a shift in perspective.  

### White swans

## We Just Can't Predict Everything

Many standard statistical models fail to account for extreme events.  

- Fat tails matter more than averages.  
- Human cognitive biases blind us to rare events.

## Fragility and Antifragility

Some systems are fragile and break under stress, while others benefit from disorder.  

### Fate of dice

### Subsection: Silent Evidence

Silent evidence is data we **don’t see** because only survivors are visible[^2].

## Conclusion

Learning to recognize black swans and designing robust systems is more practical than predicting them.
