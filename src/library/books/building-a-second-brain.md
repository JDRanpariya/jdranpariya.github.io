# Notes

I'm not big fan of the way he organizes things, I have my own obsidian setup with which I like more but there are idea which I found def helpful to start my journey.

The [[ Name ]] you see anywhere is becuase of my obsidian linking, I still have to figure that out.

- Using Progressive Summarisation for distilling notes
- There are few things more satisfying than the feeling of making consistent progress.
- Each time you decide to add a highlight, you are developing your [[Judgment]]
- Curious about [[Archipelago of Ideas]] and [[Hemingway Bridge]] is good way to continue where we left of in work.

#### Express
- Dial Down the scope: Ship something small and concrete
- Waiting until you have everything ready before getting started is like sitting in your car and waiting to leave your driveway until all the traffic lights across town are green at the same time.
- You can't wait until everything is perfect.
- Whenever you feel resistance in doing something dial down the scope.
