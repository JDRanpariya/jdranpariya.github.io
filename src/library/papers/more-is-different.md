A short, influential essay arguing that **novel laws and phenomena emerge at higher levels of complexity** and therefore cannot always be derived from microscopic laws alone. Andersonâ€™s piece is a classic statement about emergence, broken symmetry, and the hierarchical nature of scientific explanation.

**Why I include it:** foundational reading for thinking about emergence, reductionism, and why disciplines like chemistry, biology, and (complex) systems require their own principles in addition to fundamental physics.
