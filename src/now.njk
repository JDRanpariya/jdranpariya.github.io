        <p>This page looks annoying and needs some work :P</p>
        <p> Anyway this week was fun, I spontanously registered for Salsa, Improv Theatre and 
        Frisbee. I had first class for Salsa and Improv, and I'm really liking it!! <p>
        <p> I'm currently reading Anti-Fragile by Taleb, currently on a section where he talks
        about political systems and I find it super boring. Makes me think if I should pick up,
        Why We Sleep for a week.

        Finally rebuilding my old site that was taking ages due to perfectionism. Using it to improve my writing skills and learn in public. Sometimes the best way to beat procrastination is just to ship it.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif text-accent">Current Mindset</h2>

      <p>
        I'm in this phase where I want to do something out of the ordinary. Be hyperaggressive where there are boundless upsides with minimal downside. I'm trying to shift from being someone who plans and plans and plans to someone who just does things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exposing myself to as many opportunities as possible - applying for thesis positions, reaching out to people for collaborations, putting myself out there more. The reason you're reading this site is part of this shift. I've wanted to rebuild it forever, but perfectionism kept me stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to get obsessive over building rather than just consuming. Trying to create a cycle between building something while learning, not just hoarding knowledge in Obsidian forever.
