    <p class="text-lg text-secondary mb-4">
      <strong>Digital Lifeform Project</strong> - Designing embodied intelligence from first principles. Not another task-solving agent, but a digital organism that senses, learns, adapts, and evolves through existence itself.
    </p>
    <p class="text-secondary">
      This combines evolutionary learning, 3D modeling, robot learning, agentic AI, and simulations. I want to understand the entire pipeline, find bottlenecks, and see what can be improved. I really need to commit and start this properly - it's my flagship project but I haven't actually built anything yet. Tomorrow becomes today, right?

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif text-accent">Current Mindset</h2>
    <div class="prose-custom text-lg mx-auto space-y-4">
      <p>
        I'm in this phase where I want to do something out of the ordinary. Be hyperaggressive where there are boundless upsides with minimal downside. I'm trying to shift from being someone who plans and plans and plans to someone who just does things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exposing myself to as many opportunities as possible - applying for thesis positions, reaching out to people for collaborations, putting myself out there more. The reason you're reading this site is part of this shift. I've wanted to rebuild it forever, but perfectionism kept me stuck.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to get obsessive over building rather than just consuming. Trying to create a cycle between building something while learning, not just hoarding knowledge in Obsidian forever.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif text-accent">Random Thoughts This Week</h2>
    <div class="bg-card p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
      <div class="prose-custom text-lg space-y-3">
        <p>Started thinking about how understanding animal emotions could inform digital lifeform design. If I want to build something that truly adapts and persists, it needs some form of emotional regulation system.</p>
        <p>The more I read about morphogenesis and biological intelligence, the more I think current AI is missing something fundamental about how intelligence emerges from physical constraints.</p>
        <p>Need to stop overthinking my thesis applications and just send more emails. The worst thing that happens is they say no, which is the same as not applying at all.</p>
        <p>Realized I spend too much time on YouTube shorts when I'm stressed. Working on reducing screen time and actually enjoying life outside screens.</p>
