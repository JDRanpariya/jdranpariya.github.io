This page looks annoying and needs some work :P

Anyway this week was fun, I spontanously registered for Salsa, Improv Theatre and Frisbee. I had first class for Salsa and Improv, and I'm really liking it!!

I'm currently reading Anti-Fragile by Taleb, currently on a section where he talks about political systems and I find it super boring. Makes me think if I should pick up, Why We Sleep for a week.
