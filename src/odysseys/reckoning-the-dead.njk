      An exploration of forgotten brilliance, the people and ideas that shaped our world 
      but slipped through the cracks of collective memory.

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <div class="prose prose-lg mx-auto text-muted max-w-3xl">
    <p>
      While reading <em>Antifragile</em>, I stumbled upon Poincaré, a mathematician who 
      understood chaos theory and other interesting modern concepts long before they became famous. 
      His brilliance was staggering, yet I'd never heard of him until that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sparked a question: how many other brilliant minds have been lost to time? 
      How many transformative ideas were discovered, forgotten, and rediscovered decades later?
    </p>
    <p>
      This odyssey is born from sheer curiosity, a desire to resurrect these forgotten 
      voices and understand why some ideas fade while others endure. Join me as I dig 
      through history's footnotes to find the people and thoughts that deserve a second look.
