**Note:** Work in progress.

### General Idea
I firmly believe that the reason we seek more knowledge is to build a better model of the
world - one that helps us predict, adapt, and thrive. For me, **Education** means understanding
everything there is to know about existence itself. And since humanity has already gathered
vast amounts of knowledge across millennia, the best place to start is by studying what we
already know.

This space is my attempt to do that, to explore systematically how all areas of knowledge
connect, evolve, and inform one another. Here you'll find structured explorations,
self-created learning curricula, and reflections on how understanding grows when viewed as one
coherent system rather than scattered disciplines.

### What Should I Do? (Efficient Learning Strategy)

1. **Find the Best "Top 5-10" First**
    
    - Look for **commonly recommended books** in the field.
    - Check **citations, reviews, or expert opinions**.
2. **Skim & Identify Core Ideas Quickly**
    
    - Not all books need a full read—skim to extract **unique insights**.
    - Look for **overlapping principles** across multiple books.
3. **Use "Meta-Learning" to Save Time**
    
    - Read **summaries, lecture notes, or expert interviews** to validate a book’s importance before diving deep.
4. **Go Beyond Books**
    
    - Engage in **practical application, discussions, or real-world projects**.
    - Books give **theory**, but **mastery** comes from **doing**.

I like the above given chart by ChatGpt and I will keep on updating as I learn more and more to make more accurate timeline to get bigger picture on how we have evolved as species and learned things to become what we are today.

Let's first define how are we going to refere to Timeline in years. Well guess what I don't know much about calanders and time keeping. Let's learn about  [[Calendars]] first.

I feel like we don't know much about time at all and the way we should have our calendars and spans out our history.

Current Science can be branched into following
- Formal Sciences [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_science#Branches)
- Natural Sciences [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_natural_science#Branches_of_natural_science)
- Applied Sciences [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_applied_science#Branches_of_applied_science)
- Social Sciences [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_social_science#Branches_of_social_science)
- Philosophy [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy#Indian)

Out of all I think I will start with [[Cosmology]] 
> I'm realizing learning is going to be haywire no fixed path to be followed


Little did I know. Cosmology is part of Astronomy. I thought Cosmology to be fundamental subject as in Religious Cosmology it's beginning of everything. But doesn't look like that is how we categorize knowledge. 

Astronomy is big domain having all these fields. Now I went to see the outline of Astronomy on wiki pedia and seems like It falls under space science which also encompass the Engineering aspect of it which is Astronautics. For some reason astronomy is branch of Physics as well.

Anyway will stick to cosmology and add Space Science as tag.

I think I should start learning about the subject with it's history and origin. 
1. Learn origins and History
2. Find some good compendium and look through
3. Course from Top University or online platforms, classcentral.org

### 🛠️ Principles to Guide in the Journey

- Start with Universals, Move to Particulars
	- Begin with the most fundamental ideas that explain the widest range of phenomena (e.g., logic, math, and physical laws).
- Embrace a Recursive Learning Approach
	- You will revisit core concepts repeatedly, each time with new depth and clarity. This reflects the way real discovery works—by spiraling deeper into the unknown.
- Balance Theory with Experimentation
	- Knowledge without application is incomplete. As you learn, create models, test ideas, and engage with real-world phenomena.
- Think Across Domains
	- Many breakthroughs arise at intersections (e.g., the birth of AI from neuroscience and mathematics).
