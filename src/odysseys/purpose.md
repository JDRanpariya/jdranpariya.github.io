#### Evaluating your interests

- who you are currently? 
	- I'm son to my parents, brother to my sibling. A friend to few. And unknown relation to others.
	- To me, I'm curious and ambitious person who tries to do everything, plans for it ends up doing obvious and very little of what I planned due to overwhelming nature of information and my curiosity to know it all. What would I do with that? Make Ideal decisions, in Ideal world. Acquiring knowledge about anything is my nature. Sometimes I get blinded by hormones, resulting in zero/low motivation and fuel for laziness and procrastination. I always feel I need to know more to make a decision. Maybe a reason for my procrastination. I give a task unbounded time.
- Understand your values. What do you believe in? 
	- Devotion 
	- Reciprocity
	- **Openness & Acceptance**
	- **Thoroughness**
	- Perfectionism
	- **Communication**
	- **Human well-being and progress**
	- Empathy
	- **Organization & Planning**
	- Balance & Wholeness
	- Justice
	- Equality & Fairness
	- Freedom
	- Co-operation
	- **Self-actualization**
	- Boldness
	- Curiosity

- What is my passion?
	- Learning and Growth

> [!attention] 
>  I have to try new things without worrying about them becoming my passion or successful, just do it for the fun of it and see what happens.
### [[Pranav Abraham]]
