  <!-- Hero / Greeting -->
  <div class="text-center space-y-4">
    <p class="text-6xl md:text-8xl font-serif">Hello, it's me Jay!</p>
    <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl max-w-2xl mx-auto">
      I'm a polymath obsessed with <strong>building digital life</strong> that learns, adapts, and evolves.
      Currently doing my masters in AI while exploring everything from neuroscience to emotional regulation to self-organizing systems.

  <!-- The Real Story -->
  <div class="prose-custom text-xl mx-auto space-y-8">
    <p>
      Here's the thing about me - I can grasp new concepts at an unparalleled speed and
     I'm actively building myself to be antifragile in life. Maybe it's because I grew up reading Safari magazine's with my father telling us random knowledge bits about everything from spy agencies to scientific discoveries. Or maybe it's just how my brain works.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I have a bachelor's in data science and computer science, but honestly, that's just the formal part. What really drives me is this insatiable desire to understand intelligence itself - how it emerges, how it adapts, how we can build it into machines that don't just solve tasks but actually <em>exist</em> and persist like living beings.
    </p>

    <p>
      Used to be a knowledge hoarder, I still do :) I map out entire curriculums in Obsidian, consume everything, link everything, 
      but then one day when I was burned out I realized - what's the point of all this epistemic foraging if I'm never going to use it? 
      Now I'm focused on compressing knowledge directly into habits I can practice. I am moving away from being highly idealistic to more realistic as time is passing and I love it, I still get lost into my ideal self, sometimes you can't help it.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 7th grade I decided not to pursue biology for financial reasons, even though I was in love with the subject. Turns out choosing the trendy CS path led me to AI, and now I'm thinking about how to connect everything - biology, neuroscience, embodied intelligence. Life has a way of bringing things full circle.

  <!-- Philosophy & Approach -->
  <div class="space-y-6">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif text-accent">How I Think About Things</h2>
    <div class="prose-custom text-xl mx-auto space-y-6">
      <p>
        I believe in being hyperaggressive where there are boundless upsides with minimal downside. Like cold emailing companies and institutes where there might be no chance - I don't lose anything, but the potential upside is huge. Got my Fraunhofer job this way.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        But in life overall, I prefer slow gradual progress and a calm, serene approach over burnout culture. I've been through the rush and learned there's a better way to live meaningfully. Having clarity about what you want in life is crucial - check out my lifebook and purpose pages if you're curious about my framework.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think the future is about moving humanity beyond Maslow's basic survival needs so we can tackle the really big problems - harnessing energy from our solar system, understanding reality to its core so we can manipulate it at will, bioengineering, AI for scientific discovery. That's the stuff that gets me excited.

  <!-- Personal Quirks -->
  <div class="space-y-6">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-serif text-accent">Random Things About Me</h2>
    <div class="prose-custom text-xl mx-auto space-y-4">
        <p>   I keep a journal—not religiously, but I love writing things out when I need clarity. I use simple pencil highlights in books and manage my entire life in Obsidian. MacBook Air and iPhone 13 mini because I'm drawn to minimal, focused tools.</p>
        <p> I'm genuinely terrible at making decisions when I have multiple options. I overthink everything and can spend embarrassing amounts of time on simple choices. I'm also not great at dealing with people sometimes, but I'm actively working on that.</p>
        <p> I use social media intentionally—no passive scrolling except for YouTube shorts, which I'll admit is my weakness. Love playing badminton, frisbee, any team sport really, plus board games and cooking. </p>

    Let’s Connect
  </h2>
  
  <p class="font-sans text-base sm:text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed">
    I’m available to share insights about AI and its applications/risks, and I’m 
    always up for collaborations on projects that aim to understand and build 
    intelligence in the most natural, safe, and comprehensible way possible.

  <p class="font-sans text-base sm:text-lg text-muted leading-relaxed">
    Not working on a project? No problem.
I also love <span class="text-primary font-medium">casual chats</span> 
— bouncing around cool ideas, talking about what moves you, or just talking about life.
