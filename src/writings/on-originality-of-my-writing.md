You might notice, it's work in progress! I wrote this in my journal and today I just upload it
raw here, I don't mind fine tuning later 😝, yes this is on production env!!

Note: title might not go well with content, I would probably think about it later ":D)

### Why do I want to write about it?

Since childhood I had a feeling that there is nothing left for me to invent, After learning about Newton's Laws, Models
of Atoms and more physics, I used to ask myself how do I invent something new? Everything seems to be already invented, some of my friends also shared same
thoughts.

As I grew up, in high school I wanted to have a blog which would give me side income at the time
, I chose to write article on deep web, I learned about it and felt like how is it that nobody
knows about it? Wanted to share a way people could get their feet wet with [Tor](https://leavotech.blogspot.com/2018/06/Tor-browser-dark-internet-be-anonymous.html) and Onion network(
It's crazy how I got 45 comments, totally irralevent. I don't know why people do that, even more funny
I've replied to one of those comments, what a joke).
But main focus was to do better SEO, Marketing and eventually have monetized via ads. I did launch 
youtube video explaining how-to deepweb and linked article, shared it on all relevent groups on social
media. It didn't get any further, poor drive. 

After couple years while I was doing my bachlors, I wanted to write something and get noticed in
the tech community to leverage writing as networking. I had recently started dipping my toes into linux and was into rabbit holes,
I decided to write about my dilemma on what shall I spend my time on(I just checked it doesn't exist anymore on hashnode.dev, wtf!! What better time then this
to have personal sites huh ;) Fortunetly, Archive saves the day you can find it [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20220518185417/https://jdranpariya.hashnode.dev/jds-dilemma)

I'm kinda perfectionist, that hurts when you want to just start something or even continue.
To begin, I never believed I could do something creative. It doesn't feel natural or comes naturally to me.
When people say they do art or write books, I just can't comprehend it, how the fuck do you do something out of nothing that's original or even close?
Very hard to believe, I wrote this much while I say that. **Magic is in doing without thinking much**.

As time passed, I started more and more content, curiosity drives me crazy. I realized for everypaid resource
there is better free resource if want to learn anything and not just one gazillions of them.I simply
can't convience myself to write about something, feeling of scaming people stops me. Best I thought I could do was
maybe by sharing [self-learning curriculums](/odysseys/the-codex-of-understanding/)(roadmaps for learning subjects that fency me!) I make 
after reviewing exhausive amount of resources *(I'm extremly thourogh)*, which might be interesting for people
who are exploring the topic.

It was in covid I learned about the idea of creating luck for yourself while reading Naval Ravikant. I've
wrote few personal esseys to my friends but wasn't able to make connection on how could I leverage it.
Few months back, I was figuring out what [skills] I could invest in for high leverage in long term. Writing was one of them.
Back of my mind I always wanted to learn it but didn't end up doing it. Now that I've renewd my
personal site, I find a bit of motivation as it aligns with my current mindset and vision.

I learned interesting things about randomness while reading [Black swan](/library/books/black-swan),
increasing your exposure to the world is one way of creating more luck, personal sites is neat way
to achieve it and writing about things that fency me, learning in public and notes of my own. I do it
either way in obsidian why not make it public?
I've been intrigued by the act of writing, since I started to journal back in Oct 2022. I was excited to 
learn how to write well but wasn't able to put it into practice. And I felt this is good opportunity
to start writing and see how it goes.

I always feel I'm living collection of books I've read and people I've heard. But maybe I'm forgetting
my individuality and power of perception and perspective. I don't know what to start writing, but I had
thought in mind that I want to write something and over days slowly ideas kept coming about what I could write.
They were exiting day dreams, where I just starting thinking about an idea and how that better fits
into the blog post and how cool it looked. Finally I decided to write multiple of them but start
by addressing one of the pressing issues that makes me hesitant to write anything, that being if
I ever would be able to write anything original, be of value to other people or just repeated dump of
already existing information?

### My Motivation of writing in public
- I want to increase my exposure to world, greater luck surface area
- I want to learn clear, pursuasive thinking and writing, writing brings clarity
    - This serves as catalog of how my writings evolve
- Helps me practice a [skill] - "Bias for action"

### On citing works

It would be very often that the idea or examples I state are not my own, 
only thing that can be mine is the perspective through which I see them 
and try to get joy, actionable insights, or being able to see the invisible picture by
conneting dots(applying it to fields or problems that haven't been applied to yet).
I believe in doing my best to cite the references at the end of the articles, 
if you ever find a gap, please write me, credit shall never be due.

It's crazy I don't believe I am ever gonna write something like, [How do I deal with my emotions by Elizabeth](https://www.elizabethfilips.com/post/7-how-i-deal-with-my-emotions).
I feel it's either too personal or adds no value as people already know everything
(btw biggest delusional roadblock someone can have who wants to just write. Grow up Jay!).


#### TODO
- [ ] I want to know if it's better to split this into multiple articles?
- [ ] write about what "original writing" means for me
- [ ] provide some suggestions on how could someone get started(bias for action, what to write about?)
- [ ] I want to keep it more towards how I want the structure to be and not what would be the best structure for 
readers, currently I want to treat it as my own notes and less a tutorial on "how to get started on writing", no it's not.
- [ ] I don't know how much of this feeling is true, but instead of having big audience I would like to have
less people who resonate with the writings and read for the sack of enjoyment while learning something new.
